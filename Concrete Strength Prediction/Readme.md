## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict **concrete compressive strength** based on its ingredients and curing time. Stronger predictions lead to stronger structures.

📘 Based on the [Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength) from UCI ML Repository.
