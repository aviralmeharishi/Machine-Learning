# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Predictor 🔍

Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Cancellation Predictor** – a machine learning-powered app that helps hotels forecast whether a booking is likely to be canceled. This project dives deep into customer behavior and booking trends to reduce losses and optimize planning! 📉📈

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses historical booking data to predict whether a reservation will be canceled. With the power of EDA, data preprocessing, and machine learning (specifically XGBoost), we’ve built a robust classification model that provides reliable predictions for the hospitality industry.

🔧 **Tech Stack**:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📉
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- XGBoost 🌲
- Streamlit 🌐

## 📊 Key Features

- 🕵️‍♀️ **In-depth EDA**: Unveils key patterns behind cancellations.
- ⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling**: Smarter sampling to boost performance.
- 🧠 **Modeling with XGBoost**: Achieved **77% accuracy** and **0.69 F1-score**.
- 🌍 **User-Friendly Web App**: Try it live and make predictions in real-time!



## 📈 Model Evaluation

| Metric        | Score  |
|---------------|--------|
| Accuracy      | 0.77   |
| F1-Score      | 0.69   |
| ROC-AUC Score | 0.83   |

## 🔍 Insights from the Data

- 🏨 City hotel bookings are more likely to get canceled than resort hotels.
- 📅 Longer lead times often indicate higher cancellation risk.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Group bookings show different behavior than individual ones.
- 🇵🇹 Guests from Portugal showed unique patterns in cancellation.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- ⏱ Real-time retraining with new booking data.
- 🌍 Regional insights based on customer country.
- 📲 App integration for hotel front-desk usage.
