# 🚀 Insurance Premium Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **insurance premiums** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
By analyzing various factors like **age, income, health score, smoking status, policy type, and more**, we develop a model that estimates premium amounts with high accuracy.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from **Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 12** on Kaggle.  
🗓️ **Competition Duration:** December 1, 2024 – January 1, 2025  
🔗 **All rights to the dataset belong to Playground Series Kaggle.**  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational purposes only—no real-world insurance policies were harmed in the making! 😄  

## 🔍 Approach  
1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization and feature insights.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.  
3️⃣ **Model Selection:** Trying **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.**  
4️⃣ **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing for best performance.  
5️⃣ **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for model assessment.  
6️⃣ **Deployment:** Implemented via **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.
