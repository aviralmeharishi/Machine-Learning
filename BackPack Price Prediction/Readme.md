# ðŸŽ’ Backpack Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting backpack prices using machine learning techniques. We analyze various features such as brand, material, size, and other attributes to build a predictive model.

## Key Features

-   **Data Exploration**: In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
-   **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to prepare data for modeling.
-   **Model Building**: Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor to predict backpack prices.
-   **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and generating predictions on test data.

## Libraries Used

-   `numpy`
-   `pandas`
-   `matplotlib`
-   `seaborn`
-   `sklearn`

## Data

The dataset includes:

-   `train.csv`: Training data with backpack features and prices.
-   `test.csv`: Test data with backpack features for price prediction.
-   `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission format.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd backpack-price-prediction
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Run the notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Backpack\ Price\ Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Files

-   `Backpack Price Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
-   `train.csv`: Training dataset.
-   `test.csv`: Test dataset.
-   `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission file.

## Results

The model's predictions are saved in the `submission.csv` file, ready for submission.
