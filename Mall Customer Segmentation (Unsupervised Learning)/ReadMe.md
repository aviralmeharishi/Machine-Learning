# 🛍️ Mall Customers Segmentation 📊

Welcome to the **Mall Customers Analysis** project!  
This project uncovers hidden patterns in mall customers' spending habits using **clustering algorithms** and **visual storytelling**. Perfect for marketing teams aiming to understand and target customer groups better! 🎯

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their **spending score**, **annual income**, and **age**, helping businesses tailor their strategies for better customer retention and targeted promotions.

🔧 **Technologies Used**:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy 📊
- Seaborn & Matplotlib 📈
- Scikit-learn 🤖
